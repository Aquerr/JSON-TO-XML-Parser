## JSON2XML-Parser

Version: 0.0.3

JSON2XML-Parser is a program for parsing JSON files to XML without values.

All objects from JSON file are translated to empty XML-tags with attributes.

I couldn't find any parser that converts JSON objects to XML-tags with attributes (instead of tag values) so I simply made my own parser.

## Usage

1. Run the .jar file once to generate two folders for input and output.
2. Place your .json files in input folder and run the .jar file.
3. Your newly generated xml files should exist in output folder.

## For Developers

After cloning the repository. Open it in your IDE, refresh maven dependencies and run. No extra setup needed.
